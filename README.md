# University-Work
This is a repository containing all of the projects I worked on as a computer science major at Mercer University

## Data structures and Algorithms
> Each of these should come with a compiled a.out executable, if not there should be a typescript file that showcases the functionality
* [RPN calculator](CSC245/Prog2)
* [Zip and Unzip Utils](CSC245/Prog3)
* [Djikstras Algorithm](CSC245/Prog4)

## File structures and Algorithms
* [Wc and Tail Utils](CSC310/labs/lab1) ```./wc and ./tail```
* [Cmp Util](CSC310/labs/lab3)  ```./myCmp```
* [Tar Util](CSC310/projects/Prog2) ```./Jtar```
* [B-Tree implementation](CSC310/projects/Prog3) ```./a.out```

## Organization of Programming Languages
* [The Poker Project(s)](CSC330/poker) ```This Project is one project done in 10 languages```
* [The Poker Project Extended](CSC330/ruby-renegades)```An extension of the poker project to implement jokers```
* [The Collatz Project](CSC330/collatz)```Also done in 10 different languages, any languages with a 'fixed' file should be used with that instead of the 'collatz' file```

## Introudction to Artificial Intelligence
> Each should include an a.out executable and a typescript
* [Tic-tac-toe](CSC380/Labs/Lab3)
* [Game of Nim](CSC380/Prog1)
* [Game of Life](CSC380/Prog2)
* [Simple Chat Bot](CSC380/Prog3)

## Software Engineering I
* [The M-Project](CSC480/mrpoject) ```make run server and make run client```

## Software Engineering II 
* [Website Project](public_html/websites)
* [index file for the project](public_html/index.html)
* Link to the website itself is currently hosted [here](http://webclass.cs.mercer.edu/~ia)
* Documentation can be found [here](http://webclass.cs.mercer.edu/~ia/MProject/mproject.html)

## Operating Systems
* [cybash](csc460/bashingbears/cybash) custom shell
* [fastestsync](csc460/bashingbears/fastestsync) Syncs up to 27 processes
* [Safe Diner](csc460/bashingbears/safeDiner) Dining philosophers

## Assembly Language
* All of the projects from this course may be found [here](csc322/csc322-fall2023). Some of these files won't work on machines that don't support NASM and can otherwise be fairly dangerous depending on how your machine is set-up. Some are fairly interesting though so I will still link to them.
