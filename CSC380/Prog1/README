Algorithm:
    1) Check each possible move to see if it is in the unsafe file. 
        If there is no safe move take as many chips as possible from
        any of the piles
    2) When a lose state or an unsafe state has been reached, record the previous board state
        and its combinations to the unsafe file. 
    3) Repeat this over and over again

Problems:
    The problems with my algorithm are fairly apparent. It is very inefficient, creating a very long
    unsafe file. Additionally, it does not account for anything past the nine combinations before it lost
    In order to make it better I would definitely make sure it isn't inserting any repeat values, which I think it is right now, and I would try to make it look two steps back when it is learning instead of just one step back. This would help it learn faster as to what states it should avoid.
