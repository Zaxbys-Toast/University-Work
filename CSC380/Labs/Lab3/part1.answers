a)It's being implemented as an array of strings 

b)Protected is used so that the attributes can be accessed by classes that extend it.

c)When c = 9/when all of the slots are filled

d)The function goes through a square, then recursively calls the function on the next square until it is finished. This works well for 
a puzzle of this size but won't be super fast on a larger puzzle.

e)This nueral network was made using recursion that sends and recieves messages saying what they are so others can't be them and was trained on 260,000 data sets
