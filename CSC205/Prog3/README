Problem Description: 
	We need to build a data base that contains employee data. This will need to be able to add new employees, change pay, upload and download data to a file, 
	and print all of the employees out.

Solution:
	We will have a total of four classes:
		1. Employee
			-This will be an abstract class that sets up the other two employee classes
			-It will contain methods to make a new employee, a method to increase the pay of all employees, pad strings (for formatting), and getter/setter
			 methods for a String name and a double wage
			-The abstract method will be the compute pay method as it will be different in each employee class
		2. SalariedEmployee
			-This will contain a constructor that uses super, a toString method that will print out the yearly salary and name in format
		3. HourlyEmployee
			-This will contain a constructor that uses sper, a toString method that will print out the hourly pay and name in format
		4. Personnel
			-This class will be the main program. It wil have methods to print all employees, create new employees of differnt types, format the wages so they
			look right, increase pay for all employees, a menu method to print the options menu, methods to upload and download from a file, and a method to
			compute and print paychecks based on wage.
			-The data that will be uploaded and downloaded will be of the Employee type. This will allow for employee data to be stored after the program exits.
			-The employee ArrayList will be declared globally in order to simplify some calls in methods
