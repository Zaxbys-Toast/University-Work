1. The size of an ArrayList is how many objects are contained within the Arraylist
   and the capacity of the ArrayList is how many objects the ArrayList is able to hold before expanding.

2. It can hold a changing amount of elements. Whenever the capacity is equal to the size the capacity is doubled

3. They are mutable and able to change size

4. One advantage of arrays is that they take up less space if you know exactly how many values you need and another is that arrays work much quicker.
